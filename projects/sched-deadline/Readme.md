Task Scheduling

You have _n_ tasks to perform. Each task _i_ has a deadline _d<sub>i</sub>_ and if you perform the taks by the 
deadline you earn a profit _p<sub>i</sub>_, otherwise you don't get any profit. As an example

|Name | Duration | Deadline | Profit|
|---  |  ---     |     ---   |    ---|
|A    | 1        | 2        | 70|
|B    | 1        | 1        | 23|
| C    | 1      | 2         | 27 |
| D     | 1     | 1         |25 |
|E      | 1     |3          |15|
