Task Scheduling

You have _n_ tasks to perform. Each task _i_ has a deadline _d<sub>i</sub>_ and if you perform the taks by the 
deadline you earn a profit _p<sub>i</sub>_, otherwise you don't get any profit. As an example

Name | Duration | Deadline | Profit
---    ---          ---       ---
A    | 1        | 2        | 70
B    | 1        | 1        | 23
